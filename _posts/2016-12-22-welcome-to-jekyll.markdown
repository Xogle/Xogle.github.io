I was looking for a really cool way to blog. Jekyll was intimidating at first but ended up being nice and easy to setup and use!

The code snippets are also very pretty!

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
